CarShare: Turning Idle Cars into Opportunity
The Problem
In every city, thousands of cars and bikes remain parked for hours, especially during office hours. On the other hand, many people can’t afford to buy a car or bike but need affordable transportation to earn a living.

Car owners spend ₹3000 to ₹5000 per month just on parking fees, while their vehicles sit unused. Meanwhile, youngsters who could earn money by driving face challenges like owning a vehicle or securing affordable transportation.

This creates a gap:

Vehicles are underutilized.
People lose money on parking.
Many young drivers miss opportunities to earn money because they don’t have vehicles.
Our Solution
CarShare is an application that connects car owners with verified drivers. Here's how it works:

Car Owners: Instead of leaving their vehicles idle, they can rent them out during the day.
Drivers: Verified drivers can rent these vehicles and use them for transportation or other work (like delivery services).
At the end of the day, the car is returned to the owner.
Win-Win for Everyone
For Car Owners: They earn up to 10% of every ride's revenue, turning parking costs into profits.
For Drivers: They get an affordable way to drive and earn money without the need to buy their own vehicle.
Why This Matters
Empowering Youngsters: Many young people struggle to find stable jobs. With CarShare, they can start earning immediately as drivers, whether it’s for delivery services, ride-sharing, or personal transport.
Reducing Wasted Resources: Instead of cars sitting idle, they can be put to productive use.
Building a Sustainable Community: Car owners and drivers work together to create a system that benefits everyone.
How It Works
For Car Owners
Register Your Car: List your car on the app with basic details and availability.
Set Your Schedule: Specify the hours when your car can be rented (e.g., during office hours).
Earn Money: Get paid a percentage of each ride taken by the driver using your car.
For Drivers
Sign Up and Verify: Create an account and complete a simple verification process.
Search for Cars Nearby: Use the app to find cars available for rent near your location.
Rent and Ride: Rent a car, use it for your needs, and return it to the owner at the agreed time.
