## **Introduction**

ReDrive is a mobile app that transforms the way parked vehicles are utilized. Instead of incurring hefty parking charges, vehicle owners can rent out their idle cars and bikes to individuals needing affordable transport solutionsâ€”such as delivery drivers, gig workers, and logistics professionals.

The app also ensures vehicle safety and user trust by leveraging advanced IoT devices, real-time tracking, and a secure payment system. As e-commerce and gig economies expand, ReDrive envisions becoming the go-to platform for shared vehicle rentals.
