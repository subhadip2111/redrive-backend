# **ReDrive: A Smarter Way to Utilize Parked Vehicles**

---

## **Introduction**

ReDrive is a mobile app designed to optimize the use of parked vehicles. Instead of paying hefty parking fees, vehicle owners can rent out their idle cars and bikes to individuals like delivery drivers, gig workers, and logistics professionals. 

This platform aims to capitalize on the growing demand for quick e-commerce deliveries by becoming the interface to connect vehicle owners with renters. ReDrive ensures vehicle safety and builds user trust through advanced IoT devices, real-time tracking, and secure payments. 

The project is built in multiple phases to enhance security, scalability, and sustainability, ultimately creating a safe and innovative shared mobility ecosystem.
