ReDrive: A Smarter Way to Utilize Parked Vehicles
Introduction
ReDrive aims to revolutionize how we think about vehicle ownership and utilization. Instead of leaving vehicles parked on roads or paying hefty parking fees, vehicle owners can rent out their cars and bikes through the ReDrive app. This provides a win-win solution for both vehicle owners and individuals needing affordable transport solutions, such as delivery drivers and gig workers.

ReDrive not only facilitates vehicle sharing but also ensures security and trust through advanced IoT integrations, real-time tracking, and a transparent payment system. With the rise of quick commerce and the gig economy, ReDrive envisions becoming a pivotal interface for connecting vehicle owners with users while maintaining safety, scalability, and profitability.

Features
Rent out parked vehicles (cars and bikes) to individuals.
Secure payment system with revenue sharing for owners.
Location-based vehicle search and real-time tracking.
IoT integration for keyless entry, geofencing, and theft prevention.
Advanced safety features in later phases (e.g., RFID, Raspberry Pi).
Fleet management and logistics solutions for businesses.
Tech Stack
The following tools and technologies will be used across different phases of ReDrive:

Frontend
flutter/react-native (for mobile app development)
Expo or Native Base for component libraries
Redux/Context API for state management
Backend
Node.js with Express.js or Nest.js
Socket.IO for real-time communication (for tracking, alerts)
Kafka/RabbitMQ for message queues (in Phase 3 onwards)
Database
MongoDB: For flexible, schema-less data storage (vehicle listings, users).
PostgreSQL: For relational data (bookings, payments).
Redis: For real-time geofencing and caching.
Cloud and IoT
AWS IoT Core: For managing IoT devices.
Google Maps API: For geolocation and tracking.
Raspberry Pi: For IoT security integration (keyless entry, theft prevention).
Firebase Cloud Messaging: For push notifications.
